# **The Slow Space Editor — Exploring Temporal Practices in Creative Work**  
*A Research Prototype for Attuning Writers to Slowness, Ritual, and Embodied Creative Process*

The **Slow Space Editor** is an experimental writing tool developed within a UCSC HCI research group. It explores how “slowness” and temporal awareness can influence creative work. Instead of prioritizing speed or productivity, the tool supports writers in engaging with intentional pauses, embodied rituals, and reflective creative rhythms.

This repository documents the project, its research approach, and contributions made during user testing and analysis.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

The Slow Space Editor investigates how writing tools can:

- Introduce intentional slowness into the creative process  
- Encourage writers to reflect on their pace, rituals, and emotional states  
- Help users break away from fast-paced, efficiency-driven writing norms  
- Explore how embodied interaction changes the experience of writing  
- Reveal how temporal friction can shape creativity  

The tool was evaluated through a series of user studies examining how writers respond to slow, reflective interaction patterns.

## 🧠 **My Role in the Research Process**

I joined the project during its **user testing, qualitative research, and analysis** phases. Despite joining later in the timeline, I quickly became a core contributor to the study process and analytical direction.

My responsibilities included:

### **📋 1. Participant Recruitment & Study Facilitation**
- Recruited new participants to expand the study cohort  
- Ran participant sessions independently, including:  
  - Walkthroughs of the prototype  
  - In-session observation  
  - Post-use semi-structured interviews  
- Ensured consistency in data collection across sessions  

### **🧪 2. Prototype Testing & Iterative Refinement**
- Tested each iteration of the Slow Space Editor internally  
- Reported usability issues and unexpected participant behaviors  
- Helped refine instructions, flows, and prompts used during sessions  

### **📝 3. Qualitative Data Analysis**
- Coded interview transcripts and behavioral notes  
- Identified patterns related to:  
  - Creative rhythm  
  - Emotional responses to slowness  
  - Friction, pacing, and ritual  
  - Engagement and disengagement cues  
- Collaborated closely with the team to synthesize findings and shape the research narrative  

### **🤝 4. Group Collaboration & Direction Setting**
As highlighted in my recommendation letter:  
- I contributed meaningful insights during weekly research meetings  
- Took initiative in organizing and running study sessions  
- Helped articulate next steps and potential refinements  
- Strengthened the team’s analytic depth and momentum

## 🧩 **Study Structure**

The research followed a multi-step process:

1. **Prototype Orientation** — Introducing participants to the concept of slowness in creative tools  
2. **Interactive Session** — Participants used the Slow Space Editor while being observed  
3. **Follow-Up Interviews** — Exploring their emotional, cognitive, and creative responses  
4. **Qualitative Coding** — Identifying themes across sessions  
5. **Synthesis** — Merging observations, quotes, and insights into a cohesive understanding of the tool’s impact  

The study emphasized **lived experience**, **embodied creativity**, and **temporal awareness**.
